# Otonoco AI Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Otonoco AI coding challenges! 

These challenges are designed to cover a wide range of topics and will test your programming skills. These programming challenges cover for Web, Backend and/or AI development. 

This challenge combines AI integration with modern frontend development, testing both technical skills and user experience design capabilities.

## ü§ñüåê AI-Powered Coding Challenge

### Objective
**Challenge: AI-Enhanced Regulatory Document Explorer**

Build a simple regulatory document discovery app that demonstrates AI integration with frontend development. This is designed to showcase your approach to problem-solving, architecture decisions, and implementation skills within a limited timeframe.

### Core Requirements (Choose 2-4 to implement)

1. **Basic Regulatory Interface**
   * Fetch regulatory data from a public API (e.g., SEC Edgar API, FDA API, or FCC API)
   * Display document list with basic information (title, date, agency, document type)
   * Create a simple detail view for selected documents
   * Basic responsive design

2. **One AI Feature (Choose One)**
   * **AI-powered Search**: Natural language search using any AI service
     - Example: "show me recent FDA drug approvals" or "find banking regulations about cryptocurrency"
   * **AI Document Analysis**: Generate compliance summaries or key points from regulatory text
   * **AI Content Summary**: Use AI to create concise summaries of complex regulatory documents

3. **Basic User Features**
   * Simple bookmarking system with local storage for important documents
   * Basic filtering (by agency, date, or document type)
   * Loading states and error handling

4. **Technical Implementation**
   * Choose one frontend framework (React, Vue, or vanilla JS)
   * Integrate with one AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face)
   * Basic state management (can be simple useState/reactive data)
   * Clean code structure with comments explaining your approach

### What We're Looking For
* **Problem-solving approach**: How you break down the requirements
* **Architecture decisions**: Your choice of tools and structure
* **AI integration strategy**: How you handle API calls, errors, and user experience
* **Code quality**: Clean, readable code with clear intent
* **Trade-off awareness**: Understanding of what you prioritized and why

### Deliverables
* Working application (hosted link or local setup instructions)
* Brief README explaining:
  - Your approach and architecture decisions
  - Which features you chose to implement and why
  - Any challenges faced and how you solved them
  - What you would improve with more time
* Simple, clean codebase with key decisions documented

### Optional Bonus (If Time Permits)
* Add compliance risk scoring or document categorization
* Implement document comparison features
* Add simple data visualization (charts for document trends)
* Include regulatory change tracking or alerts

## Submission Guidelines
* Upload your code to GitHub/GitLab.
* Include a README.md with:
* Instructions to run the app
* Any known limitations or trade-offs
* Your thought process and architecture decisions
* Documentation of AI integration and regulatory data handling approach

## Time Estimate

4‚Äì6 hours total. Focus on demonstrating your **thought process and technical decision-making** rather than completing every possible feature. We're more interested in seeing how you approach problems and structure solutions than in a fully-featured application.

## Evaluation Focus

This challenge is designed to give us insight into:
* How you approach technical problems and make architectural decisions
* Your understanding of AI integration patterns and user experience considerations  
* Code organization and documentation skills
* Ability to prioritize features and manage scope within time constraints

The goal is to have a meaningful technical discussion about your implementation choices, trade-offs, and potential improvements.
